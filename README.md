socket based chat for those secret company meetings.

This project was inspired by chat rooms - the original private message. It's built with Socket.io, and enables users to send text & image messages.
It's not meant to be glamarous or effective, but rather it helped me understand the underpinnings of how messaging services like this work.
It could also be used as a free version of Olark, with some modifications.

Requires Socket.io, Express, Express-Handlebars, & Bootstrap.
